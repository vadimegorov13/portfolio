# Welcome to My Portfolio Repository

This repository contains the source code for my portfolio, which is built using the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) JavaScript framework and the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) utility-based CSS library. The project is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Getting Started

To get this portfolio and edit it, you will need to follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vadimegorov13/portfolio.git

# 2. Install the dependencies:
npm install

# 3. Start the development server:
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

This will start the development server, and you should be able to view the portfolio at http://localhost:5173.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready build of the portfolio in the `public` folder.

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## Built With

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - A JavaScript framework for building web apps

  <p class="text-zinc-400">Hi there,</p>

  <div class="mt-10 max-w-[40rem] text-zinc-400 flex flex-col gap-10">
    <p>
      My name is Vadim Egorov, and I have recently completed a Bachelor of
      Science, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in mathematics at the
      University of Alaska Anchorage. My education has provided me with
      proficiency in Python and Java and hands-on experience in data analysis
      and machine learning. Additionally, I am a self-taught web developer with
      strong skills in TypeScript and various web dev frameworks. I am capable
      of building and maintaining modern web applications, with a focus on
      back-end development and server-side logic.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have a deep passion for technology and a drive to stay up-to-date with
      the latest advancements in the field. In addition to technology, I am also
      interested in education, history, music, art, philosophy, neuroscience,
      and economics.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am seeking a software development role where I can put my technical
      skills and passion to use and continue to learn and grow as a developer.
